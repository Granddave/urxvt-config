urxvt_config
============

ouR eXtended Virtual Terminal Unicode config files.

## FONTS
I mainly use nerdfont from here https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts

## Perls scripts
Actually there is a library of script that is widelly available on distros,
the github is 'muennich/urxvt-perls', it works well for the main needed feature,
like zooming font, searching on url, and better searching in the buffer.

After some time, I was searching a solution to switch the color scheme,
so I found this fork johntyree/urxvt-perls wich add this feature so I switched.
